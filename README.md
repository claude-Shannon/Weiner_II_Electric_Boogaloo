## Shannon and Greg's Embedded II Final Project

#### An LMS/Weiner adaptive filter for the purpose of seperating mother and baby heartbeats from a pregnant person's EKG. 

We are implementing this project on a Zybo board, utilizing its Zynq chip, which has an ARM Cortex-A9 processing system interconnected with regular FPGA logic fabric. 


We are using Vivado's toolset, including the High-Level Synthesis (HLS) software to accelerate pieces of our C/C++ code into hardware.
